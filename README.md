# impact-car-features
**Problem Statement:** 

To find optimized pricing and product development decision to maximize profitability to meet consumer demand.

**Design:**

1. We have the data regarding different vehicle styles, their features, price, popularity over the years.
2. I have started with time series analysis of all the features using pivot table and pivot chart to find how the automotive market has evolved over time.
3. For this I have summarized the data by finding the average values of numerical features, prices and popularity for each vehicle style for each year. 
4. In order to understand the specific details about which vehicle styles are popular over years, which features of these vehicle styles are the most popular and have made them popular, I have narrowed down the data to top 3 vehicle styles which are popular and least costly in each year.
5. Then I have used exploratory analysis to find popular car features and market categories which can be focused for research and development.
6. Next, I have tried to understand the relationship of prices with car features and used regression analysis to find out which features have direct impact on price and can used to predict the car prices.

**Findings and Insights:**

1. Increase in avg. price was seen after 2000 and 2007, and a sharp fall was seen on 2012 and 2014.
2. In the year 2001, cars with engine Hp more than 400 and no. of cylinders 12 were introduced.Engine HP was increased to near 600 to 550 after 2008.Similarly, the year 2012 and 2014, electric cars with higher engine HP were introduced.
3. Front wheel drive and all wheel drive have increased 2015 onwards.
4. Post 2000 we are seeing different fuel types being used apart from regular unleaded.But the fuel demand has drastically increased after 2014. This has paved way for different fuels, but still the difference in the usage is huge.
5. Automatic Transmission type vehicles are made more.
6. Avg City MPG (miles per gallon) and Highway MPG has also increased after 2007.
7. No. of cars with 4 doors have increased since 2015.
8. Avg. popularity of cars increased between 1995 to 1999 and has  decreased after 2000.Since then popularity has been lower and has increased only since 2015.
9. I have calculated the average price and average popularity of different vehicle style from 1990-2017.From the above list I have filtered out the top 3 vehicle style for each year, ranking them is descending order of popularity and avg. price lowest to highest.When filtered we get the below vehicle styles common among all the years. I have further compared the avg popularity and avg price for each style over the years.
Vehicle Style
2dr Hatchback
4dr Hatchback
Wagon
4dr SUV
Extended Cab Pickup
Convertible
Passenger Van
Regular Cab Pickup
Sedan
10. 2dr hatchback, Passenger van – The avg. price and avg. popularity has increased over the years.
For the below list, the popularity has remained the same even after increase in the avg price.
-	4dr hatchback
-	Wagon
-	Sedan
-	Convertible
11. Following features have gained popularity over the years -
-	Flex-fuel
-	Direct Drive
-	Four wheel drive
-	4 doors
12. In terms of fuel efficiency these vehicle styles - 4dr hatchback. 2dr hatchback, sedan, wagon, convertible, coupe top the list.
13. The regression analysis of different car features and prices show that Engine HP and car price are highly correlated and have a high determination coefficient. This feature can be used to predict car prices.

**Conclusion:**

1. The vehicle styles – 2dr, 4dr hatchbacks, sedan, wagon, passenger van, convertible are popular over the years and lower prices.
2. The popular features - Flex-fuel, Direct Drive, Four wheel drive and popular market categories Flex fuel, SUV, Factory tuner, Diesel, Hybrid suggest involving sustainable technology in the cars.
3. But the popular vehicle styles do not have these features.
4. In order to increase the popularity of these features the manufactures should focus on product development using the features mentioned above.
5. The engine HP is directly related to the car prices more than the other features.
6. We do not have the data of profitability or manufacturing cost of the cars and the features, hence the optimized price and right features to focus during product development could not be determined.
